            My name is Camryn and I am currently a computer science major with a minor in digital arts and sciences at the University of Florida. I am a problem solver who appreciates the challenges of tech and wishes to contribute in growing my field of software engineering. I am the kind of a person who has to succeed because I am afraid to fail. As someone who has experienced the effects of substance abuse and addiction in my household, I have felt a pressure to make the the right choices - to be a positive reflection of my family. I believe that only through carefully analyzing the outcomes of our choices can we make better decisions and find the most effective solutions. To honor those Iâ€™ve lost and to support those I love, I am dedicated to improving both myself and my community - to be an example of success.             </p>

            <p className="text-xl">
            My primary interests lie in software engineering, UI/UX design, and full-stack development. I find joy in working with all layers of the stack and creating user-friendly, efficient websites.

            My journey into tech began in high school when I took my first computer science course. Although I felt intimidated and lacked confidence in my skills, I persevered with the help of guidance and mentors. In college, I continued to explore different areas within technology, and my interest in creating web applications grew.

            As I continue to gain experiences, I am actively seeking a company that shares my values of a passion for learning and providing a positive working environment. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to make a difference in the tech industry.
